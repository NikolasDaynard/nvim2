Onivim 3?
lets go man that's an idea
Okay so like it's a neovim client but blazingly fast (tm)

Easy plugins in lua and dig into engine source performance with rust (goated idea?)

So it's like neovim but uses the gpui
NO NEEDED CONFIG FILE, everything *just works tm*
Lsp is BAKED in and *very* easy to add, 
To add an lsp you can paste in a git repo and it's added to a list of extentions
You shouldn't need to dig around in a config file, but you *can*
Everything is very plain but it's snappy, not sluggish
Has vim keybindings built in and configurable

I hate the half baked lua/vimscript nvim style so it's a new api that is *somewhat* interoperable
It's just not dumb and works properly

This is a dumb idea and yet I don't care
